Lightweight, more intuitive and useful responsive CSS framework

Responsee is an open source responsive CSS framework based on 12-column grid. Websites based on Responsee are fully responsive – they display content correctly on each type of devices.

## Lightweight
Minimum of code, great potential! Provided you look for something smaller, something lighter, something helping you to introduce project within a shorter time, Responsee is for you the right choice.

## Intuitive
Our target was creation of intuitive responsive CSS framework which even beginning web designer will cope with thanks to well-arranged structure. Result is worthwhile.

## Useful
When developing Responsee we put accent on maximal applicability for web designers. The framework will help you developing responsive websites faster than ever before. You need not wasting time with anything Responsee will make instead of you.

## Grid System
Responsee is based on 12-column grid. For work with columns it uses classes “s-1” up to “s-12”, “m-1” up to “m-12” and “l-1” up to “l-12”. By means of those classes Responsee divides website for particular columns (“s” – display on small-size screen, “m” – display on medium-size screen, “l” – display on large-size screen). In case you want to display element differently on small-size, medium-size and large-size screen, use three classes – e.g. “s-12 m-6 l-4”. Thus the element will utilize 4 columns of 12 on large-size screen, 6 columns of 12 on medium-size screen and 12 columns of 12 on small-size screen. In case the element shall utilize equal number of columns in both sizes, use class “s” – e.g. “s-4”.
The classes “s-five”, “m-five” and “l-five” represent a special category. Those classes have exactly the same functions as “s-…”, “m-…” and “l-…” classes however, thanks to their application you will manage to display content on website in five equally wide columns.
